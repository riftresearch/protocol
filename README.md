# Rift Protocol Monorepo  
Trustless cross-chain swap protocol for Bitcoin and Ethereum

#### Highlights:
- [`bitcoin-light-client-core`](./crates/bitcoin-light-client-core/): Circuit validating Bitcoin consensus within an MMR-based light client.
- [`rift-core`](./crates/rift-core/): Circuit handling Bitcoin<>Ethereum order settlement and light client state updates.
- [`contracts`](./contracts): Solidity smart contracts for handling auctions, orders, and light client state.
- [`hypernode`](./bin/hypernode): Bitcoin and Ethereum indexer that generates swap proofs, settles challenged proofs, and detects and removes orphan blocks submitted to the light client.
